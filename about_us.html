	        		<h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
	     		</div>
	     		<h4>1. <i>What is your major? What are you involved in at university?</i></h4>
	     		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		      	I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I am also a cadet in Air Force ROTC. Additionally, I  do undergraduate research at the <a href="https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/">Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems</a> at Mississippi State University.
		      </div>
		      	 <h4>2. <i>What are your career goals?</i></h4>
	     		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		      	Upon graduation, I will commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. My prospective AFSC is Cyber Operations (17S/17D). I plan on attending the Air Force Institute of Technology to receive an M.S. in Computer Science immediately after commissioning. While in the Air Force, my goal is to protect Department of Defense computer assets from foreign/domestic adversaries. After my time in the Air Force, I plan to get a PhD in Computer Science. With it, I would like to do research in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">Computational Complexity Theory</a> and work as either a government contractor or as a research professor at a university.
		      </div>
		      <h4>3. <i>Why do you want to do research in Computational Complexity Theory?</i></h4>
	     		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		      	I find the relationship between mathematics and computer science fascinating, especially in the realm of P versus NP problems. For example, the problem of prime factorization is currently an NP problem, since we do not have an algorithm  to perform prime factorization in polynomial time (on a classical computer). For cryptography, we rely on problems like prime factorization being fundementally difficult to compute. But what if there is some "clever" algorithm to find the prime factors of a number? What makes some problems fundamentally more difficult than others? These are the types of questions I would like to investigate. The protection of all of our data relies on the presumption that there does not exist an algorithm that can compute prime factors of a semiprime in polynomial time. 
		      </div>
		      <h4>4. <i>What are your hobbies?</i></h4>
	     		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		      	I like snowboarding, running, playing guitar, and learning new things in computer science and mathematics.
